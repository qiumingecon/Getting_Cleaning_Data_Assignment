**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: Peer-graded Assignment**

The Github repository submission is done by Ming Qiu, as required by Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 

**Files:**
* CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R: a R script that performs the following five steps to prepare the tidy dataset. 
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 * Tidy_Data.txt: submitted dataset, having gone through the five cleaning steps above.
